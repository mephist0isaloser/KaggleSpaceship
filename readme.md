# Spaceship Titanic Prediction Competition

## Overview
Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic Prediction Competition on Kaggle! In this competition, you are tasked with using your data science skills to solve a cosmic mystery. The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner, collided with a spacetime anomaly, resulting in almost half of its passengers being transported to an alternate dimension.

Your mission is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship's damaged computer system. By doing so, you can help rescue crews retrieve the lost passengers and potentially change history!

## Getting Started
### Recommended Preparation
We highly recommend participating in Kaggle's "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition to familiarize yourself with the basics of machine learning and Kaggle competitions.

### Getting Started Notebook
To quickly get started, make use of the provided starter notebook available in the repository.
